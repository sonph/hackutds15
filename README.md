# InstaJS
[InstaJS](http://sonpham.me/r/instajs) is an awesome innovative disruptive advanced cross-platform scalable user-friendly high-performance dynamic collaborative realtime inline _&lt;insert your favourite buzzwords here&gt;_ debugger for JavaScript.

J/K. This is a realtime inline debugger for JavaScript aimed at those who are learning to code, with Facebook Parse backend database integration for easy code snippets sharing.

# Why
No one likes debugging and writing log messages, so we hacked together this webapp to help coders especially beginners to quickly write code and see how different statements and changes to the code affect the flow of the program.

No more littering your source code with log messages and see how all the variables change to what values and at what points as the program runs, in a timeline from top to bottom!

This was partly inspired by [Bret Victor's _Inventing on Principle_ talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUv66718DII), but his original editor isn't published AFAIK.

# Features
* Realtime inline debugging. Change one character and see how the rest of the program flow changes!
* Integration with Facebook Parse database backend for easy code snippets sharing, especially for beginning coders who often want to send code to someone for questions.
* Fancy UI
* Web-based cross-platform

# How
Fundamentally, it's JavaScript's `eval()` (it's not as easy as you think, so we had to do lots of clever tweaks and hacks).

# The Technologies
* pure JavaScript for source code preprocessing, evaluating and parsing
* AngularJS
* RamdaJS
* Ace Editor
* MaterializeCSS
* Facebook Parse
* jQuery
* other stuffs
 * Dozens of cans of Redbull
 * Brains with lots of grey matter
 * Also massive amount of dark energy and anti-matter
